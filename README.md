# API Automation Testing with Robot Framework and Python

This repository contains a Robot Framework project for automating the testing of APIs using Python and Robot Framework.
Robot Framework is a versatile and easy-to-use test automation framework that allows you to create test cases in a readable and expressive way.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the API automation tests on your local machine.
